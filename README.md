## Work Experience
**Prompt Engineer @ Meta via TEKSystems (_Feb. 2025 - Present_)**
- Conducted various A/B testing experiments on new features within Meta AI studio. Performed detailed evaluations of AI chatbots built on Metaâ€™s Llama models to ensure accuracy, memory retention, personalization and safety. Deployed to over 3 billion end users.
- Designed and maintained Google Sheets templates used by over 130+ annotators, created data visualizations to present key statistics.
- Wrote qualitative reports (QRs) to identify trends, highlight areas for improvement and communicate key findings and recommendations to stakeholder to drive the development of new features and guidelines.

**Data Scientist Intern @ Rocketbrew (_May. 2025 - Jun.2025_)**
- Wrote Python scripts with Selenium to scrape job posting data from 200+ company websites, adding 6 new features to the original database to augment message context, leading to a 20% boost in message quality compared to baseline messages.
- Cleaned, parsed, and transformed JSON format unstructured text data into tabular data for integration into machine learning pipelines.
- Implemented RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline for data retrieval, enhancing message relevance and personalization by 30% demonstrated by higher median cosine similarities between messages and contexts.
- Implemented ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load external data from web scraping to a Postgres database hosted on Azure, streamlining data ingestion and storage and improving data retrieval efficiency and scalability.
- Generated messages using Large Language Models (GPT-3.5 & Llama 3), LangChain framework and advanced prompting methods.

## Projects
### PagePilot [Code](https://github.com/Rachel0619/PagePilot)
A multi-modal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application that allows you to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. The system can process and understand text, tables, and images within PDFs to provide comprehensive answers.

### VanTrails [Code](https://github.com/Rachel0619/VanTrails)
VanTrails is an intelligent trail recommendation system that helps hikers discover the perfect trails in Vancouver, BC. Using advanced RAG technology, the system provides personalized, conversational recommendations based on user queries like "I want an easy hike with my dog near Vancouver" or "Show me challenging winter trails with great views."

## Volunteer Experience
**CRM Specialist @ AI Summit Vancouver (_Aug. 2025 - Present_)**
- Built and maintained automated marketing workflows in CRM system (SendPulse) to streamline sponsorship acquisition and ticket sales, engaging 450+ potential attendees and 100+ sponsors through targeted and strategic email campaigns.

**AI Engineer @ Delta Rising Foundation (_Aug. 2025 - Present_)**
- Currently conducting research and developing machine learning models to estimate carbon sequestration of western hemlock in Oregon using multi-source remote sensing data and satellite imagery.
