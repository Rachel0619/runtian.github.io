- Developed and maintained a scalable annotation workflow by building task-specific Google Sheets templates for 130+ annotators, streamlining data collection, and visualizing performance metrics to track quality trends and identify improvement areas.
- Collaborated closely with research scientists and engineers to translate human evaluation insights into actionable improvements, authoring 20+ analytical reports that informed model updates, feature development, and evaluation guidelines.

**Data Scientist Intern @ Rocketbrew (_May. 2025 - Jun.2025_)**
- Designed and delivered a Generative AI product to create highly personalized cold outreach messages for salespeople.
- Wrote Python scripts with Selenium to scrape job posting data from 200+ company websites, adding 6 new features to the original database to augment message context, leading to a 20% boost in message quality compared to baseline messages.
- Built a message generation pipeline using LLMs (OpenAI and open-source models) with LangChain framework and advanced prompting methods.
- Implemented RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline for data retrieval, enhancing message relevance and personalization by 30% demonstrated by higher median cosine similarities between messages and contexts.

## Projects
### [PickLLM](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Rachel0619/PickLLM)
An LLM recommendation application that helps developers and researchers choose the most suitable large language model for their specific needs. The system analyzes over 200 models from the LMArena leaderboards, factoring in use cases, license types, latency, and costâ€“performance trade-offs. Powered by real-time pricing data from the OpenRouter API, it delivers personalized recommendations through an interactive Flask web app hosted on Hugging Face. Featuring an intuitive questionnaire flow, a RAG-based chatbot, and LLM-generated explanations, the platform transforms hours of manual comparison into a minute-long, conversational experience.

### [VanTrails](https://github.com/Rachel0619/VanTrails)
An intelligent trail recommendation system that helps hikers discover the perfect trails in Vancouver, BC. Using advanced RAG technology, the system provides personalized, conversational recommendations based on user queries like "I want an easy hike with my dog near Vancouver" or "Show me challenging winter trails with great views."

## Volunteer Experience
**CRM Specialist @ AI Summit Vancouver (_Aug. 2025 - Present_)**
- Built and maintained automated marketing workflows with CRM system (SendPulse) and Automation 360 to streamline sponsors cold outreach and ticket sales, engaging 100+ sponsors and 450+ potential attendees through targeted and strategic campaigns.
- Created detailed CRM workflow documentation and coordinated cross-functionally via Asana.

**Data Scientist @ Delta Rising Foundation (_Aug. 2025 - Present_)**
- Lead a team of four in developing a carbon sequestration estimation model that integrates ground-truth forest measurements with Sentinel-1/2 satellite imagery to quantify biomass at scale, supporting climate impact assessment.
- Built a robust ETL pipeline to extract and preprocess satellite data from Google Earth Engine, and automated data loading into Google Cloud BigQuery for downstream analysis and model training.
